# Learn Python

Teaching computer science through Python programming.

## About

This blog is based on an educational [Instagram](https://instagram.com/learn.py) account. Unique snippets of code are uploaded to social media along with in-depth explanations of the hypothetical purpose and behavioral algorithm of each. Each post is relevant to a concept in either Python programming or general Computer Science. The idea of this blog is to provide a easily, freely, and openly accessible resource for Computer Science students and coding enthusiasts that is not typically found in other popular platforms.

> NOTE: Not all posts on Instagram are uploaded to GitHub and not all uploads to GitHub are posted on Instagram. However, most are available on both.
